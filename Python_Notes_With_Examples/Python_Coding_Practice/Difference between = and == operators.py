"""Task 1 :
1) Explain the difference between the = operator and the == operator in Python
= operator - it is used to assign values to a variable. Example : a = 10 - here value 10 has been assigned to the variable a using the = (assignment operator)
 == operator - it is used to check if the given operands are equal or not. example: a=5 b=5 print(a==5). here the output is True since both a and b are equal.
2) What does the ** operator do in Python, and how is it used?
** is an Exponentiation operator. it is a process of repeated multiplication by raising the value to its power. Example
a = 3 #here a is the base .
b = 4
print(a**b) # here base (a) 3 will be multiplied 4 times.
3) What does the ^ operator do in Python, and in what context is it commonly used?
^ operator is called - XOR operator. this operation is performed between every two corresponding bits of a number.
Example
a = 3
b = 4
print(a^b)
0 0 - returns value as 0 (false ^ false - false
1 1 returns value as 0 (true ^ true = false)
0 1 returns value as 1 (false ^ true = true)
1 0 returns value as 1 (true ^ false = true)
based on this bit table, bit values of a and b are calculated and returns us the o/p.
here in this case the o/p is 7"""
