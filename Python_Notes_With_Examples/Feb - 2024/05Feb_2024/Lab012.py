#take input from the user and we want to add the value

#Step1 - take input from user
#step2 - sum

a = input("Enter first number :")
b = input("Enter second number :")
c = int(a)+int(b)
print(type(a))
print(type(b))
print(c)
print(type(c))

#str + str - will give the output combined or concatation
#always covert the value (if the i/p is number) - convert the datatype to int
#also int can be converted into str
#use int while takig the input as well
